    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

    <p>At UltraTVZone, we strive to provide the best possible IPTV service. We understand that sometimes things may not work out as expected. Please read our refund policy carefully.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility for Refund</h2>
    <p>Refunds are generally not provided for digital services once the service has been activated and used. However, we may consider a refund in the following exceptional circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If there is a technical issue on our part that prevents you from accessing the service for an extended period, and we are unable to resolve it within a reasonable timeframe.</li>
      <li>If you accidentally purchased a duplicate subscription.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
    <p>Refunds will NOT be issued in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you change your mind after purchasing the subscription.</li>
      <li>If your internet connection is unstable or too slow to stream our service.</li>
      <li>If your device is not compatible with our service (please check compatibility before purchasing).</li>
      <li>If you are banned due to misuse of the service (e.g., sharing your account).</li>
      <li>If you have already used the service for a significant period.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>All refund requests must be submitted within <strong>24 hours</strong> of purchase. To request a refund, please contact our support team via WhatsApp or email (ultratvzone@gmail.com) with the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your full name</li>
      <li>Email address used for purchase</li>
      <li>Date of purchase</li>
      <li>Reason for refund request</li>
      <li>Any relevant screenshots or error messages</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Refund Process</h2>
    <p>Once your refund request is received and reviewed, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within a certain number of days.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>UltraTVZone reserves the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting on our website. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>
